        <p>For our final project, we will build an online calendar designed for college students.  This calendar will make adding the dates of class assignments and exams easier.  Instead of manually entering events one item at a time, Carolina Calendar will automatically fill in these dates for you with just one click. Students will be able to search for their classes and quickly add their class assignment and exam dates to their calendar.</p>
        <p><a href="carolinaCalendar.html">Here is what the calendar will look like.</a> This page will display the student's view of the calendar.    </p>
        
        <p><a href="addEvents.html">Here is an example of what a class will look like.</a>  Students can click the "Add Events" button to import all of the dates into their own calendar.  </p>
