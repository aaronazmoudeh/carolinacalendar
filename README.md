Carolina Calendar is a dynamic web calendar which fills in with the assignments you need to do on their respective due dates.
All the assignments are located in a database.

The calendar layout and style is created using HTML and CSS
The calendar is created using JavaScript, which generates the months and dates for the calendar
JavaScript is also used to create a search function which helps you search for your classes
Once you add a class to calendar on the front end, AJAX calls are given to the back end which then uses PHP to manipulate
a database of classes and assignments using SQL commands
Your assingments are then returned to the front end and posted on the calendar on their respective due dates
You can also delete a class from your calendar, which will remove the assignments from your view
